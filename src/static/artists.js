     I love tattooing and challenging myself everyday to learn more styles of work.
     While I love illustrative traditional and stipple designs, I am devoted to being
     a diverse tattooer so that I learn from all areas of tattooing and cultures.
     Please message me on my Instagram page @pb.and.tattoos. to set up an appointment
     with me. Thank you for your time!`,
